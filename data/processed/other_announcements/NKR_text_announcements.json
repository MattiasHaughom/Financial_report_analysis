        "text": "Oslo, 19 December 2024: Scatec ASA, a leading renewable energy provider, has\nreached financial close for the second 60 megawatt (MW) of the 120 MW Mmadinare\nSolar Complex in Botswana and is preparing for construction start.\n\nIn August 2022, Scatec, signed a binding 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA)\nwith Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) for a 60 MW solar PV facility in the\nMmadinare District. In the third quarter 2023, Scatec was awarded a 60 MW\nexpansion of the project, taking the total capacity to 120 MW.\n\nThe estimated total capital expenditure for the 120 MW project is BWP 1.5\nbillion (USD 108 million) with an estimated engineering, procurement, and\nconstruction (EPC) contract value to Scatec of BWP 1.2 billion (USD 88 million).\nThe solar power plants are estimated to be financed by BWP 1.0 billion (USD 73\nmillion) of non-recourse project debt, and the remainder by equity from Scatec.\nFinancing for the projects will be provided by the First National Bank of\nBotswana (acting through its Rand Merchant Bank division) and the World Bank's\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC).\n\nScatec owns 100% of the project and will be the designated EPC company, as well\nas asset manager (AM) and operations and maintenance (O&M) service provider.\nConstruction and operation of the power plants will be managed by Scatec's\norganisation in South Africa. Scatec is targeting to reduce its long-term\neconomic interest in the project by inviting additional equity partners.\n\n\"We mark another achievement for our renewable energy journey in Botswana as we\nstart construction of the second phase of the project. By doubling the total\ncapacity of the solar power plant, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nstrategy, robust business model and drive to contribute to the green energy\ntransition in Africa,\" says Scatec CEO Terje Pilskog.\n\nThe plant will be located near Mmadinare, close to the former mining town of\nSelebi-Phikwe, 400 kilometres Northeast of the capital Gaborone. The solar power\nplant will ensure that approximately 48,000 tons of CO(2\u00a0)emissions will be\navoided and can power approximately 20,000 households annually.\n\n\nFor further information, please contact:\nFor analysts and investors: Andreas Austrell, VP IR, phone:\n+47 974 38 686,\u00a0andreas.austrell@scatec.com\n (mailto:andreas.austrell@scatec.com)For media: Meera Bhatia, SVP External\nAffairs & Communications, phone: +47 468 44 959,\u00a0meera.bhatia@scatec.com\n(mailto:meera.bhatia@scatec.com)\n\n\nAbout Scatec\nScatec is a leading renewable energy solutions provider, accelerating access to\nreliable and affordable clean energy emerging markets.

        "text": "Tender offer to be launched for the acquisition of all outstanding Crayon shares by SoftwareOne\n\n19 December 2024\n\nSoftwareOne Holding AG and Crayon Group Holding ASA, two leading global providers of software and cloud solutions, today announced that they have agreed to combine. To this end, SoftwareOne will launch a recommended voluntary stock and cash offer to acquire all outstanding shares in Crayon. With total revenue of approximately CHF 1.6 billion, presence across 70+ countries and around 13,000 employees, the combined company will be excellently positioned as a preferred partner to both customers and vendors globally, driving additional growth and significant value creation for shareholders. \n\nKey transaction highlights\n\uf0a7\tCrayon shareholders to be offered 0.8233 new shares in SoftwareOne and NOK 69 in cash for each Crayon share, implying an offer value of NOK 144 per share based on SoftwareOne\u2019s undisturbed share price(1) \n\uf0a7\tOffer based on a valuation of Crayon at NOK 172.5 per share, representing a premium of 36%, while SoftwareOne is valued at CHF 10 per share in the share exchange component, a premium of 38%, both compared to the respective undisturbed share prices \n\uf0a7\tAccelerated growth and improved profitability driven by run-rate cost synergies of CHF 80-100 million to be reached within 18 months of completion, incremental to SoftwareOne\u2019s previously announced cost savings of over CHF 50 million, as well as significant revenue synergies driven by high business complementarity\n\uf0a7\tHighly value accretive for shareholders with EPS accretion around 25% , and over 40% excluding implementation costs by 2026\n\uf0a7\tFull support of the transaction from the founding shareholders of SoftwareOne and Crayon, holding 29% and 5% of the share capital, respectively, with the SoftwareOne founding shareholders having pre-committed to vote in favour of the necessary resolutions at a SoftwareOne shareholders\u2019 meeting and the Crayon founding shareholders having pre-committed to tender their shares in the offer\n\uf0a7\tCompletion of the transaction expected in Q3 2025, subject to customary conditions, including a minimum acceptance of the offer of at least 90% of Crayon shares on a fully diluted basis, as well as SoftwareOne shareholder approval and regulatory approvals\n\uf0a7\tCrayon to appoint two nominees to be proposed as additional members of the SoftwareOne Board of Directors; CEOs Raphael Erb and Melissa Mulholland to be named as Co-Chief Executive Officers of the combined company \n\nCompelling strategic rationale \nThe transaction is based on the combination of two leading global software and cloud solutions providers, with a complementary geographical footprint, customer base and offering.\nThe combined company will be uniquely positioned to capitalise on the USD 150 billion addressable market, which is growing at \u2018mid-teens\u2019 driven by mega-trends, including public cloud adoption and increased focus on managing cloud spend, data & AI and security. Both companies have a customer-centric business model and an aligned go-to-market approach. By joining forces, SoftwareOne and Crayon will create a larger marketplace and enhance their differentiated services offering. Their deep relationships with the hyperscalers will be further reinforced, with increased importance to vendors given combined scale and ability to offer global access across customer segments. Furthermore, SoftwareOne\u2019s scalable global and local delivery model and transactional platform will support approximately CHF 16 billion of billings in total.\n\nThe combination delivers value creation through substantial revenue and cost synergies. Run-rate cost synergies of CHF 80-100 million within 18 months of completion have been identified, incremental to SoftwareOne\u2019s previously announced cost savings of over CHF 50 million. They will be achieved through scale and efficiency across currently sub-scale local operations, integration of offices and functions, a scalable transactional platform with shared service centers, increased sales efficiency and improved utilisation of the combined services delivery network. Implementation costs are expected to be within the same range as the run-rate cost synergies. \n\nIn addition, significant revenue synergies have been identified, including expanded customer access, in particular to larger customer accounts, based on combined capabilities, certifications and authorisations. Significant cross- and upsell opportunities are also expected from the enhanced services offering. Furthermore, the company will be in a position to increase coverage of the SME segment by leveraging both SoftwareOne\u2019s digital sales hubs and Crayon\u2019s channel platform. \n\nDaniel von Stockar, Founding Shareholder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of SoftwareOne, said \u201cWe are excited to announce a new chapter for SoftwareOne and Crayon. This is a unique opportunity to bring together our complementary businesses, highly qualified teams and shared values based on entrepreneurial spirit. The business combination sets the stage for any ownership scenario, and we will now focus our efforts on completing the transaction successfully and integration. The compelling strategic rationale and substantial synergy potential are set to create significant value for our shareholders, including those joining from Crayon.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe see a fast-growing market opportunity as organisations continue to drive digital transformation,\u201d added Raphael Erb, Chief Executive Officer of SoftwareOne. \u201cTogether with Crayon, we will have a broad global presence with extensive local reach, strong hyperscaler partnerships, including with Microsoft, and enhanced service offerings to meet customer needs. Building on our strong value-based foundations as leading global providers of software and cloud solutions, we will be very well positioned to drive accelerated growth and improved profitability.\u201d \n\nRune Syversen, Founding Shareholder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Crayon, said \u201cWhen we established Crayon in 2002, we had four goals: to be the customer\u2019s trusted advisor, to deliver with quality, lead with integrity and recruit the best people. Twenty-two years later, delivering on these goals has been fundamental to our success in becoming a global leader in IT and tech services. Combining Crayon and SoftwareOne will create an even stronger global player as we represent complementary businesses with substantial synergy and profitable growth potential that will generate significant value for our shareholders and employees.\u201d \n\n\u201cBy combining the strengths of Crayon and SoftwareOne, we are in a unique position to grow our global footprint and deliver exceptional value to our partners and customers as well as capitalise on new market opportunities. Our strong hyperscaler partnerships, including with Microsoft, will give us a strengthened services offering that will meet future customer needs,\u201d said Melissa Mulholland, CEO of Crayon. \u201cI look forward to working with the SoftwareOne team, and my main priority is to ensure that our strong entrepreneurial and people-first culture remains the driving force in building our future together.\u201d \n\n\u201cSoftwareOne and Crayon have been strategic channel partners for Microsoft, and we are grateful for the work both companies have done to serve our joint customers over the years,\u201d said Judson Althoff, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer of Microsoft. \u201cAs these companies come together, I\u2019m excited to see the added value it will bring customers such as broader geographical coverage and enhanced service offerings to support their business transformation needs.\u201d\n\nRecommended voluntary offer to Crayon shareholders\nIn view of the transaction, SoftwareOne will make a voluntary offer to acquire all outstanding shares in Crayon pursuant to the Norwegian Securities Trading Act. The shareholders of Crayon will receive 0.8233 new shares in SoftwareOne and NOK 69 in cash for each share in Crayon. The implied offer value is NOK 144 per Crayon share, based on SoftwareOne\u2019s undisturbed share price . This represents an overall premium to Crayon shareholders of 13% compared to the undisturbed share price.\n\nThe offer is based on an agreed valuation of Crayon at NOK 172.5 per share, which represents a 36% premium to the undisturbed share price, with a consideration of 40% cash and 60% shares. The share component assumes an exchange ratio based on an agreed valuation of SoftwareOne at CHF 10 per share, representing a 38% premium to the undisturbed share price. \n\nThe Board of Directors of Crayon has unanimously resolved that it will recommend Crayon shareholders to accept the offer. Crayon Group Board recommendation attached in this release. In addition, the founding shareholders of Crayon, holding 5% of Crayon\u2019s share capital, have pre-committed to tender their shares in the offer and under-taken a 12-month lock-up on their shares from the time of completion of the transaction. SoftwareOne currently holds 1.9% of Crayon\u2019s share capital.  \n\nLaunch of the offer is subject to the following conditions being satisfied: (a) the pre-acceptances shall remain valid and in full force; (b) absence of a material adverse change pertaining to Crayon; (c) the final approval of a combined offer document and prospectus by the Oslo Stock Exchange and the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway, as applicable; (d) the Board of Directors of Crayon\u2019s recommendation of the offer shall not have been withdrawn, modified or amended; (e) SoftwareOne having underwritten a warranty and indemnity insurance; and (f) Crayon shall in all material respects have complied with its obligations under the transaction agreement entered into between the parties on 19 December 2024, and there shall otherwise have been no material breach of the transaction agreement by Crayon which entitles SoftwareOne to terminate the transaction agreement pursuant to its terms.\n\nThe issuance of up to 72 million new SoftwareOne shares to the accepting Crayon shareholders, representing up to 32% of SoftwareOne\u2019s new total share capital, will require the approval by SoftwareOne shareholders. The founding shareholders of SoftwareOne, including Daniel von Stockar, Ren\u00e9 Gilli and B. Curti Holding AG/Curti AG, together holding 29% of SoftwareOne\u2019s share capital, have pre-committed to vote in favour of such resolution at a shareholders\u2019 meeting of SoftwareOne.\n\nThe companies will explore the possibility of carrying out a dual listing of the consideration shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Such a dual listing will be subject to regulatory approvals by inter alia FINMA and the Oslo Stock Exchange. It is therefore uncertain whether a dual listing will be possible.\nCompletion of the offer is expected in Q3 2025 and is subject to customary conditions, including a minimum acceptance of the offer of at least 90% of the Crayon shares on a fully diluted basis, as well as regulatory approvals. \n\nThe offer is not subject to any due diligence or financing condition. The complete details of the offer, including all terms and conditions, will be included in the combined offer document and prospectus to be distributed to Crayon shareholders following approval by the Oslo Stock Exchange and by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway. \n\nFinancial impact and financing\nOn an indicative basis, the combined company generated approximately CHF 1,595 million in revenue over the last twelve months to 30 September 2024, with adjusted EBITDA of approximately CHF 334 million excluding synergies. \nEPS accretion is expected to be around 25%, including implementation costs and phased synergies, and over 40% excluding implementation costs by 2026.\n\nThe transaction will be financed by investment grade bridge facilities of approximately CHF 700 million to fund the cash consideration and refinance Crayon\u2019s existing debt. Following the transaction, SoftwareOne expects proforma net debt / adjusted EBITDA (including synergies and implementation costs) to be below 2.0x as at 31 December 2025.\nBased on healthy cash generation of the combined company, SoftwareOne expects to maintain its current dividend policy, with a pay-out ratio of 30-50% of adjusted net profit, following completion of the transaction. \n\nCorporate governance\nThe transaction is unanimously supported by the Boards of Directors of both companies. \nThe parties have agreed that, as part of the transaction, Crayon will appoint two nominees to be proposed as additional members of the Board of Directors of SoftwareOne. The current CEOs, Raphael Erb and Melissa Mulholland, will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of the combined company.  \n\nThe combined company will have its legal domicile in Stans, Switzerland. \n\nUpdate from the SoftwareOne Board of Directors \nThe Board of Directors of SoftwareOne is convinced that the business combination with Crayon represents a significant value creation opportunity for shareholders. The company will therefore now focus its efforts on the successful completion of the transaction and integration. The Board does not exclude considering private ownership at a later stage, if in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. SoftwareOne will update the market as and when required. \n\n\nIndicative timeline \n\nMarch 2025\tPublication of Norwegian takeover offer prospectus\nMarch 2025 / Q2 2025\tTender offer period\nSpring 2025\tSoftwareOne shareholders\u2019 meeting for approval of issuance of new shares to Crayon shareholders \nQ3 2025\tCompletion of transaction, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals\n\nAdvisors\nJefferies is acting as sole financial advisor to SoftwareOne.
